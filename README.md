# Standardizing and Documenting RESTful APIs in .NET 8 with OpenAPI

This repo is about using OpenAPI to standardize and document RESTful APIs in .NET 8.

OpenAPI defines API endpoints, methods, parameters, and responses using YAML or JSON, promoting clear and consistent documentation. 

It simplifies developer collaboration, enhances API understanding, and ensures consistent design. Key advantages include automatic documentation generation and language independence, enabling efficient interaction among diverse teams. 

OpenAPI's robust tool ecosystem and cross-platform support further enhance API development and integration, improving interoperability and software quality.
